    "# Spectral Power Density\n",
    "\n",
    "In the review article, Keith starts from the statistic\n",
    "$$S_k = \\dfrac{2\\left<|\\tilde{D}_k|^{2}\\right>T_{obs}}{N^2}$$\n",
    "which Keith calls \"the one-sided power spectral noise density estimate\" and notes that the term in angle brackets is \"determined from an average over many nearby bins and excluding the bin (i) itself\" (original used i, which risks confusion with the imaginary unit).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are struggling with this choice (in large part because of the $N^2$ in the denominator) and so I want to explore the idea of spectral power density in the context of a real world signal $\\left\\{d_j:0\\le{}j\\lt{}N\\right\\}$ and its Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) defined by\n",
    "$$\\tilde{D}_k = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}d_{j}e^{-i2\\pi{}kj/N}$$\n",
    "where $\\left\\{\\tilde{D}_k:0\\le{}k\\lt{}N\\right\\}$ are the complex Fourier coefficients and I think that Keith is using the tilde to mark the complex nature of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Because we are going to end up dealing with a purely real signal we will end up with duplication in the Fourier coefficients which will mean that the Python *rfft* function will return N/2 complex values rather than the full N values. This will lead to some correction factors of 2 later on. For the moment we will ignore this subtlety and deal with the general case where both the $d_j$ and the $\\tilde{D}_k$ can be complex and there are the full N values of $\\tilde{D}_k$."

    "This confirms that our forward and inverse transforms are consistently normalized.\n",

    "NOTE: since the complex roots of unity are arranged symmetrically and uniformly around the unit circle in the complex plane. Since they occur in pairs of the form $z_n$ and $-z_n$ a sum over all the roots will yield zero as the pairs all cancel."
